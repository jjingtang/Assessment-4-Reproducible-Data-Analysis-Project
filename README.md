# Assessment-4-Reproducible-Data-Analysis-Project
The project aimed at identifying the best five starting players within the team's budget of $118 million for the 2019-20 season, presented the process of modeling, which used to identify potential valuable players for the Chicago Bulls for the upcoming 2019-20 NBA season, and discussed the findings and limitations at the end. The recommendation list includes 15 players, with 3 selected for each position based on their performance. The model has separate key indicators for each position to make the linear regression models more accurate. The recommended roster has an average age of 23.3 and could potentially cost the Chicago Bulls a total of $113,579,923.
